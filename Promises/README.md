# Understanding Promises in JavaScript

## What is a Promise?

A **Promise** in JavaScript is an object that represents the eventual completion (or failure) of an asynchronous operation and its resulting value. It allows developers to write asynchronous code in a more manageable way, avoiding the complexities of nested callbacks, often referred to as "callback hell."

## States of a Promise

A Promise can be in one of three states:
1. **Pending**: The initial state, meaning the operation is still ongoing.
2. **Fulfilled**: The operation completed successfully, and the promise has a resulting value.
3. **Rejected**: The operation failed, and the promise has a reason for the failure.

## Real-World Example: Ordering a Pizza

To illustrate how promises work, consider the analogy of ordering a pizza:

1. **Pending**: When you place an order for a pizza, it is being prepared. This is the "pending" state of the promise.
2. **Fulfilled**: Once the pizza is ready and delivered to you, the promise is "fulfilled," and you receive your pizza.
3. **Rejected**: If there is an issue (like the restaurant runs out of ingredients), the promise is "rejected," and you are informed that your order cannot be completed.

## Using Promises in JavaScript

In JavaScript, promises are commonly used for handling asynchronous operations, such as fetching data from an API. You can manage the success or failure of these operations using the `.then()` and `.catch()` methods.

### Example Code

Hereâ€™s a simple example of using a promise to fetch data:

## Interview Questions on Promises

### Basic Questions

1. **What is a Promise?**
   - A Promise is an object that represents the eventual completion or failure of an asynchronous operation and its resulting value.

2. **What are the states of a Promise?**
   - A Promise can be in one of three states: Pending, Fulfilled, or Rejected.

3. **How do you create a Promise?**
   - You can create a Promise using the `Promise` constructor, which takes a function with two parameters: `resolve` and `reject`.

### Intermediate Questions

4. **What is the difference between `Promise.all()` and `Promise.race()`?**
   - `Promise.all()` takes an array of promises and returns a single promise that resolves when all of the promises have resolved or rejects if any promise is rejected. `Promise.race()` returns a promise that resolves or rejects as soon as one of the promises in the array resolves or rejects.

5. **What happens if you call `resolve` or `reject` multiple times?**
   - Calling `resolve` or `reject` multiple times will have no effect after the first call. The promise will remain in the fulfilled or rejected state.

### Tricky Questions

6. **Can you explain the difference between synchronous and asynchronous code?**
   - Synchronous code is executed line by line, blocking the execution until the current operation completes. Asynchronous code allows operations to run in the background, enabling other code to execute without waiting for the operation to complete.

7. **What will happen if you return a promise from a `.then()` method?**
   - If you return a promise from a `.then()` method, the next `.then()` in the chain will wait for that promise to resolve or reject before executing.

### Scenario-Based Questions

8. **You have multiple API calls that need to be made sequentially. How would you handle this using promises?**
   - You can chain promises using `.then()` to ensure that each API call is made only after the previous one has completed.

   ```javascript
   fetchData(url1)
       .then(response1 => {
           return fetchData(url2);
       })
       .then(response2 => {
           console.log(response2);
       })
       .catch(error => console.error(error));
   ```

9. **How would you handle errors in a promise chain?**
   - You can handle errors by adding a `.catch()` at the end of the promise chain, which will catch any errors that occur in any of the preceding promises.

### Output Questions

10. **What will be the output of the following code?**

   ```javascript
   const promise = new Promise((resolve, reject) => {
       setTimeout(() => resolve("Success!"), 1000);
   });

   promise.then(result => {
       console.log(result);
       return "Next!";
   }).then(result => console.log(result));
   ```

   - The output will be:
     ```
     Success!
     Next!
     ```
